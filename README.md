## Description
- My idea comes from two simple, semi-frequent first game design ideas and combines them together into one.
- A combination of Snake and Pac-Man that utilizes both concepts to create an original idea.

## Features
- The utilization of the number keys or wasd to control the snake creature.
- The ability to consume or bump into different Pac-Man themed objects to grow the snake in size.
- The combination of other Pac-Man themed elements such as the ghosts and moving through walls.

## Challenges
- Specifically how to keybind certain keys to allow them to control the movement of a shape on screen.
- To control the movement of following objects so that they know when to move and where to go.
- A way of allowing the user to transition between a possible game over screen to the start.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A successful game that allows the user to play a visually obvious combination of snake and pac-man,
while being visibly and functionally pleasing.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A functioning playable snake that allows the user to traverse through the maze, run from chasing ghosts,
eat various fruits to increase the snake's size, and traverse through walls.
- Additionally, the player must be able to transition between end and start seamlessly.

## Milestones
Each week I will take the steps needed to understand each element and add them to my code.
 First week will be focused on the basics of a snake styled game.
 Second week will create some of the core mechanics of the pac-man side, including the walls and ghosts if possible
 Third week will continue on this topic if needed and continue into the visuals, including the backgrounds and screens.
